      <h1 id="page2"><span id="more">The story of the creators</span></h1> All software is developed by RATE Inc. and can be modified for use on any device platform. Software can be interfaced with all dispatch and emergent care applications currently in existence. The RATE application is sold as an individual software
      package and device procurement can be accomplished through our partner network that provides device and data packages at discounted fleet pricing. Product pricing depends on network development, but starts at $450,000 and increases based on development
      needs. Grants are available in markets where procurement and development costs far exceed the budget. These grants are approved on a case by case basis and require full financial and market information disclosure.
