      <h1 id="more">More !</h1> <p>The RATE emergency medical assistant is a device application that uses voice recognition technology and communicates across the emergency response spectrum to coordinate care and assist first responders in assessing and treating life-threatening emergent medical conditions.</p>
<p>
The system is activated by the 911 response dispatch where it notifies EMS dispatch and local emergent care facilities that an emergent care event has occurred. EMS dispatch chooses a first responder team and assigns their responder roles. Location and event data is then sent to first responders as they are dispatched to the event. Responders arrive on scene and begin to multitask as a team to log data and coordinate care. Dispatchers and hospital administrators are then able to utilize event data to route the response team to the most appropriate emergent care facility. Once chosen, the emergent care facility receives event data and is able to plan the most appropriate staffing and medical intervention plan.</p>
<p>
This comprehensive care application allows patient charts to begin at dispatch and carries through the entire care process allowing accurate patient charting and efficient care coordination. The system uses voice recognition technology to work one on one with first responders, improving their charting and assisting in care making decisions in the heat of the moment. Additionally, the system allows for body camera and microphone options to record all event data from start to finish. Individual event datasets can be utilized to assist in mitigating false malpractice lawsuits and workforce development by allowing responder teams to assess their actions through an after-action review.</p>
<p>
All software is developed by RATE Inc. and can be modified for use on any device platform. Software can be interfaced with all dispatch and emergent care applications currently in existence. The RATE application is sold as an individual software package and device procurement can be accomplished through our partner network that provides device and data packages at discounted fleet pricing. Product pricing depends on network development, but starts at $450,000 and increases based on development needs. Grants are available in markets where procurement and development costs far exceed the budget. These grants are approved on a case by case basis and require full financial and market information disclosure.</p>
